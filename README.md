- 👋 Hi, I’m @landeeno
- 👀 I’m interested in transitioning from a controls/automation engineer in the industrial space to a software engineer. Specifically, I would like to specialize in blockchain development and web3 applications. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Solidity and JavaScript. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects which are building novel ideas in the blockchain world while allowing me an opportunity to learn from mentors and better my capabilities. 
- 🧾 My current languages are: solidity (beginner), javascript (beginner), python (advanced), java (intermediate), and c# (intermediate). 
- 📫 The best way to contact me is through LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/landoncrowther/).
- 📤 I will be posting project code here as I continue to develop my portfolio.
